#Goals
#Make the game entirely playable through a gui of buttons and pictures
#Use random, data structures, and most everything we've learned.
#Have a full dungeon with branching paths, maybe even randomly shuffle the rooms.
#Have enemies to fight and challenges to overcome.
#Have loot that changes various stats, and make it realistic in what you can actually carry

#Starting variables for the player character. Maybe can add multiple classes with diff stats.
